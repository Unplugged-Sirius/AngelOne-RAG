  {
    "content": "My Stop-Loss (SL) order was triggered but it did not get executed. Why did this happen?\nThere could be 2 major reasons behind this:The asset may be lacking a buyer/seller at the defined stop-loss limit price due to a lack of market depth. Orders are queued while they are being purchased or sold.a. For example:Let’s say there are 50 buyers and 100 sellers who are waiting to trade on a scrip at ₹90. Upon reaching ₹90, the first 50 sellers’ orders will be executed, and the remaining 50 sellers will have to wait for new buyers. In case you are one of those remaining 50 sellers, yoursell orderwill remain pending if there are no corresponding buyers and vice versa.The price movement during high volatility does not fulfill certain criteria e.g. suppose you have placed asell stop-losswith trigger Price at₹100and limit price at ₹100. Now imagine that the LTP touched ₹100 (here, the SL would be triggered) and quickly went below ₹100 due to high volatility. The limit price of ₹100 means the stop-loss order would get executed at only ₹100 or more. Now this order will be pending as price is below Rs 100 and execution will happen only when price has reached or crossed Rs 100. Hence your stop-loss order was not executed.Due to this reason, we recommend keeping a sufficient gap between the trigger price and limit price to increase the chances of Stop Loss execution during high volatility.Note:In order to increase the chances of execution, we keep the default value of the limit price 2 ticks away from the trigger price. This is done so that if the LTP moves rapidly after triggering the order, the limit price shouldn’t be a hindrance and the order should still get executed. Also, if you change the pre-set limit price and bring it closer to the Trigger Price, the chances of execution can reduce in cases of volatility.",

    "content": "My stop-loss order got triggered even though the predefined Trigger Price had not appeared. Why?\nChances are that the market price did hit the stop-loss price, albeit momentarily and without you being able to spot it at that moment. Within a second, prices can change multiple times and not all of them are relayed to the Brokers by Exchange, especially during high volatility. As a result, such momentary price fluctuations are not seen anywhere.Price matching and execution of the orders  is done by the Exchanges and not the Broker.",

What happens when a stock is under the surveillance of either of these codes?\nInsolvency Bankruptcy Code (IBC):This law is incorporated to handle insolvency and bankruptcy cases. When a stock is under surveillance for IBC, it means the company is going through an insolvency procedure. For some of these stocks, trading may still be allowed subject to the stage of surveillance.Inter Creditor Agreement (ICA):An agreement between various lenders and a single borrower that describes their rights and obligations in case of a default is ICA. When a company has entered into ICA to restructure the debt, its stock comes under the surveillance. In these cases, trading in the stocks might be allowed but with certain restrictions in place.",
